# Solving local problems with the web.

Each summer, selected Web Fellows will spend their time learning and using design, development, and impact principles as part of our curriculum designed by actual employers and agencies here in Austin, removing the element of surprise when starting off in the field.

With the main focus on gaining experience through real client work, one-on-one mentoring sessions, impact projects, and field trips to agencies and different working environments, you'll get more out of this program than just basic design and coding skills.
